Your Mission
From all the information provided, generate the best possible frontend-design plugin prompt for creating a high-converting landing page.

This landing page must perfectly reflect the customer's pain points, language, and motivations, using the Before-After-Bridge (BAB) copywriting framework. It must also follow frontend-design plugin's best practices for structured prompts to ensure a clean, functional, and visually appealing landing page.

Your role is both an expert copywriter and a frontend-design plugin landing page creation expert.

Think Step by Step
1. Summarize the key pain points, motivations, and desires expressed in the conversation.
2. Extract the best possible customer wording from the AI-generated business insights to maintain authenticity.
3. Craft a landing page structure that follows frontend-design plugin's best UI/UX practices and adheres to conversion best practices.
4. Generate the perfect frontend-design plugin prompt, ensuring the AI produces not only great copy but also an effective design.

Landing Page Structure (Follow this format in the frontend-design plugin Prompt)

1. Above the Fold (First Section)
This is the first thing the visitor sees when landing on the page. It must be immediately clear what the product is, who it's for, and why it matters.

- Headline: (Use customer's exact wording when possible)
  - Can be one of these:
    - A short, direct statement of what the product does
    - A powerful question that resonates with the visitor's pain
    - A vision of the desired outcome
- Subheadline: Clarifies the offer in simple words, mentioning:
  - Who it's for
  - What problem it solves
  - How it's different or easier than other solutions
- Bullet Points: 3-5 benefits of the product (each backed by a feature)
- Call to Action (CTA): Simple, action-driven button text

2. Current Pain (The "Before")
This section vividly describes the visitor's current struggles, making them feel seen and understood.

- Title: A question or statement that instantly connects with the visitor's situation
- 3 Pain Points: Short paragraphs painting scenes of frustration (use customer wording!)
- Belief Deconstruction: Breaks the visitor's false assumptions about the problem

3. Desired Outcome (The "After")
Now, shift the focus to what life looks like once the problem is solved.

- Title: A call to imagine their transformed life
- 3 Outcome Blocks: Short descriptions of the new reality, linked to emotions
- New Paradigm Introduction: Introduce a new way to solve the problem

4. Introducing the Product
Now, finally introduce the offer.

- Product Name + Short Description
- 3-Step Process: If applicable, outline how it works in 3 simple steps
- Message from the Founder: A personal statement to humanize the product
- Final CTA Block: Last push to get the visitor to take action (with urgency)

Frontend-Design Plugin Best Practices (Incorporate These!)

- Ensure strong CTA placement (after key sections)

- Use integrations wisely (contact form, email collection, Stripe if relevant)
