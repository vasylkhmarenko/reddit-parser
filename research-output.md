# Pain Point Analysis Summary

The analysis reveals significant pain points across three key areas: career transition challenges, technical limitations of AI tools, and toxic community dynamics. Aspiring developers face unrealistic expectations about learning timelines and struggle with AI dependency, while experienced developers grapple with the deterioration of knowledge-sharing platforms and concerns about sustainable career growth in an AI-dominated landscape.

## Categorized Pain Points

### **Problems with Existing Learning Resources and Expectations**

**Unrealistic Timeline Expectations for Career Transition**
Beginners consistently overestimate how quickly they can become job-ready, leading to frustration and potential burnout.

- "Is it still realistic in 2026 to go from absolute beginner → employable in ~1 year with this time commitment?"
- "there is no way you will be employable in a year, especially since you work full time"
- "If you didn't work at all and were able to devote full time, 40+ hours a week consistently, you'll be lucky to be job ready in 4 years"
- "The hard way is do it on your own but still takes 3-4 years of self study working your ass off"

_Frequency/Intensity: Very high frequency with multiple users expressing shock at realistic timelines, indicating widespread misconceptions._

**Overwhelming Technology Choice Paralysis**
Developers struggle to choose appropriate technologies and career paths, seeking validation for their decisions rather than clear guidance.

- "Should I be looking for 'Product Engineer,' 'Full-stack Developer,' or 'Automation Engineer' roles?"
- "My uncertainty isn't 'React vs X' so much as: Is a scheduler a good project for skill growth, or a trap?"
- "Which path is safer / more future-proof right now (backend, frontend, mobile, cloud, etc.)?"
- "We're trying to decide which option makes more sense for long-term career growth"

_Frequency/Intensity: High frequency across multiple posts, with users expressing anxiety about making wrong career decisions._

### **AI Dependency and Quality Concerns**

**Over-reliance on AI Tools Leading to Knowledge Gaps**
Developers become dependent on AI for code generation but lack fundamental understanding to debug or improve the generated code.

- "i meanwhile feel like shit when i realize my apps break because i didn't update state properly, or the tailwind on my components take hours to get right, its honestly very frustrating"
- "I started trying to build a SaaS, relied too much on AI, hit a wall, and realized I didn't actually understand what I was shipping"
- "i recommend building your first 2 projects without Ai just so that you know how code works and how to know when Ai did something wrong"

_Frequency/Intensity: Moderate frequency but high emotional intensity, with users expressing frustration and self-doubt._

**AI Tools Producing Non-Functional Results**
AI-generated solutions often don't work as advertised, creating false expectations and wasted time.

- "He literally said 'kinda works', I mean srsly?"
- "I doesn't even compile"
- "It hurts me when people post about half baked projects call it 'kinda works' and think they achieved something with it"
- "evidence AI can make something that is kinda like a usable thing, but not actually a usable thing"

_Frequency/Intensity: High intensity frustration with AI quality, mentioned across multiple contexts._

### **Community and Knowledge Sharing Breakdown**

**Toxic Community Culture Preventing Knowledge Sharing**
Stack Overflow and similar platforms have become hostile environments that discourage participation and knowledge sharing.

- "everything I posted got shot down. I would find answers myself after no one else helped and I figured it out and I posted the answer and relabeled it as KB since I answered it and I came back to it weeks later and it still got downvotes"
- "comments get deleted for being dupes when they aren't. People just being toxic"
- "I agree we need that knowledge but at least ChatGTP isn't an asshole to me"
- "the CEO can shout into the wind all they want, it won't magically reverse decades of toxic community culture"

_Frequency/Intensity: Very high emotional intensity with multiple users describing negative experiences and preferring AI over human interaction._

**Loss of Sustainable Knowledge Ecosystems**
The traditional model of community-built knowledge bases is breaking down due to AI consumption without contribution back.

- "community builds a public knowledgebase → AI ingests that knowledgebase → those leaps are only available in conversations that are private by default → community members use AI instead of the knowledgebase → the knowledgebase shuts down, taking the knowledge with it"
- "Why contribute though when the answers you spend time and energy on posting just get slurped up and reused by AI?"
- "If no one is asking questions anymore, there wont be new data to train the future AI on"

_Frequency/Intensity: Moderate frequency but high concern about long-term sustainability of knowledge sharing._

### **Career Uncertainty and Market Changes**

**Confusion About AI's Impact on Job Market**
Developers at all levels express anxiety about how AI will affect their career prospects and what skills will remain valuable.

- "how has ai affected the job? what were you doing before that you aren't now and vice versa?"
- "How worried should I actually be about AI replacing junior developers in the next few years?"
- "AI is a tool for productivity, but it just means you need to be that much more well rounded and knowledgeable. The bar is much higher for what you can provide"

_Frequency/Intensity: High frequency with significant anxiety about job security and career planning._

**Difficulty Assessing Skill Level and Market Position**
Developers struggle to evaluate their abilities and understand how they fit into the current job market.

- "I want to get a 'vibe check' on my current skill level. Am I stuck in 'Junior' territory because of my years of experience, or does the fact that I'm running a live business solo move the needle?"
- "How do hiring managers view someone who uses AI and n8n to generate the bulk of the logic but handles 100% of the architectural decisions?"

_Frequency/Intensity: Moderate frequency but high personal importance for career planning._

I’m a fresh Computer Science graduate specializing in Data Science. I’ve spent the last year solo-building and maintaining a live product: a glamping resort booking platform and its internal management system.

I want to get a "vibe check" on my current skill level. Am I stuck in "Junior" territory because of my years of experience, or does the fact that I'm running a live business solo move the needle?

**The Credentials & Tech Stack:**

- **The Main Site:** Developed solo using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Focused on SEO and performance (minification, lazy loading, asset compression).
- **Admin Portal :** Built a custom internal dashboard using **React** to manage resort operations, bookings, and data.
- **Backend & Logic:** I use **n8n** for workflow orchestration and **Supabase** for the database, Auth, and real-time updates.
- **AI Integration:** Developed **AI Agents via n8n and the Facebook Graph API** that handle the official FB page chatbot (automated inquiries, booking assistance, and lead gen).
- **Infrastructure & DevOps:** The entire project runs on **Docker containers** deployed on a **DigitalOcean Droplet**, managed via **Cloudflare** for DNS, SSL, and edge performance.

**My Workflow:** I essentially **vibe coded** the majority of the site and the React portal using **Antigravity** and **Copilot**. However, I manually revised, refactored, and debugged everything to ensure it actually works as intended. I chose **n8n** specifically because I work better with visual representations of data flows and logic, which allowed me to scale the backend and integrate multiple APIs much faster than writing custom boilerplate.

**My Questions:**

1. **Leveling:** In the 2026 market, where does "Solo Architect/Maintainer" put me?
2. **Job Fit:** Should I be looking for "Product Engineer," "Full-stack Developer," or "Automation Engineer" roles? I enjoy the "builder" aspect more than just grinding LeetCode.
3. **The Vibe Coding & Low-Code Stigma:** How do hiring managers view someone who uses AI and n8n to generate the bulk of the logic but handles 100% of the architectural decisions, containerization, and debugging?

Hi, I'm a junior webdev with some experience working on ongoing projects in front-end and back-end with VueJS and C# at my job. I'm interested in starting a personal project in the same vein as this site https://kisekidle.com/, but I don't have much experience in building an app from the ground up.

I would like some advice when it comes to choice of technology, hosting, building, deploying, and anything else that isn't just straight developing new features or fixing bugs that you might deem important to know about. Do you guys know any resource that covers these more fundamental aspects to a project, or a point to start? I really value good practice and modern standards, so I don't want to just pick up the first guide I see

And if anyone would have any idea what kind of technology/framework/language was used for the site I posted above that would be cool to know as well.

I’m a hybrid dev/designer (UI-heavy, performance/accessibility focused) trying to be intentional about my next skill jump.

I’ve spent years stitching together scheduling, task, and planning tools and keep running into the same friction points. I’m considering building a personal scheduling app as a long-term project — not as a startup bet, but as a deliberate way to grow skills and have something substantial on my resume.

Right now I’m learning React via the official docs. My uncertainty isn’t “React vs X” so much as:

- Is a scheduler a *good* project for skill growth, or a trap?
- How would you scope a v1 to avoid overengineering?
- What signals would tell you to continue investing vs pivoting?

I’m early enough that I can change direction if there’s a better learning path. Looking for honest feedback from people, thanks!

Outside of using WSL2 which links to my Ubuntu folder on my windows... what terminal do y'all use to access folders on the windows side of things, and not linux? Just figure I may need to use both, and recently all I've done is open WSL2 and use the linux side of things for storing projects..

Hello I'm currently applying for junior web developer positions.

My relevant work experience is a 6-month internship at a fairly good(for my country and the field standards) company. As of now in my CV I have included only this as work experience, skipping over all the temporary jobs I have worked in(barista,waiter,customer service,summer jobs etc etc).

Some people of my circle have advised me to include all of this in my CV since im 25 and it might come off as if I have been lazy in the past if I dont include it, which isnt the truth. But me personally I dont see why I should bloat my CV with irellevant work experience that doesnt show any of the skills required for the jobs im currently applying for.

Title: Service-based company intern: MERN vs DevOps — which path is safer long-term?

Hello everyone,

My brother is currently an intern at a service-based company. The company is offering interns two training paths:

MERN stack

DevOps

Important context:

He’ll be learning from scratch in the company

Internship duration: 6 months

After that, there’s an 18-month bond

This is a typical service-based setup (client projects, internal teams, etc.)

We’re trying to decide which option makes more sense for long-term career growth, especially considering:

Future job switching after the bond

Skill relevance in the next 5–10 years

Risk of getting stuck in low-growth roles

I’ve read mixed opinions:

Some say DevOps is high-paying but not beginner-friendly

Others say MERN gives stronger fundamentals and more exit options later

For people who’ve been in similar situations or work in service companies:

Which path would you recommend specifically for an intern/fresher?

Any regrets choosing DevOps or MERN early in your career?

How easy is it to switch roles after starting in either track?

Looking for honest, real-world advice. Thanks in advance!

For context ive been learning web dev for a few months now. And i have done html, css js and react with a few projects. Also been doing dsa along with it.  
Lately i've been coming across a lot of videos on youtube about how good the ai models are now. a few vids on opus 4.5, and i saw how with a little bit of back on forth you can generate a very good application (on the frontend at least). i meanwhile feel like shit when i realize my apps break because i didn't update state properly, or the tailwind on my components take hours to get right, its honestly very frustrating.  
I really don't know what should do? its like every month a new model drops and it shifts the goalpost father than the ground you cover.  
So i have some questions i want to know the answer of:  
how has ai affected the job? what were you doing before that you aren't now and vice versa?  
how do you see the role changing in the future?  
what can a person trying to get into web dev learn and do? are the things i'm supposed to learn still the same or are they/will they be obsolete?

↳ **u/Familiar-Dark8409** (1 pts)

i recommend building your first 2 projects without Ai  
 just so that you know how code works and how to know when Ai did something wrong

and than start using Ai model when building projects  
 tho you gotta build on your own at first to understand when Ai messes up otherwise when you are building new feature you will fall into the first shitty solution the ai gives you when you are building with it, there would properly be a better solution but just because you are not knowledgeable enough you wont catch it

you should be aware of what you are building either a whole new app or just a small task

Hello. I am a senior college student majoring in Computer information systems and wanted some advice. I was to start making websites for local businesses in my area to help my income as qell as gain experience working with others and applying their ideas. What do companies look for when purchasing a website? What should I have when I pitch this to a local business? How much should I charge? While I have made many sites for fun before, I am completly new to making website for raal businesses and want to make sure I am doing it right.

I’ve been learning JS by refactoring early projects into modular systems — what kind of real-world work does this mindset map to early on?

I’m ~4 months into learning programming seriously.

I didn’t start with “I want to be a frontend dev” — I started trying to build a SaaS, relied too much on AI, hit a wall, and realized I didn’t actually understand what I was shipping.

So I reset and focused on fundamentals.

Lately, I’ve been refactoring my early JavaScript projects with a heavy focus on:

- vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- modular architecture (engine vs UI vs state)
- separation of concerns

I’m very aware I’m still a beginner — I’m missing things like proper DSA depth, and I’m not claiming job-readiness.

What I’m genuinely trying to understand is:

> For people who work with JavaScript in production — where does this _style of thinking_ realistically show up early on (if it does at all)?

Not asking for portfolio reviews or job offers.  
I’m trying to calibrate expectations and decide what direction to lean into next.

If it helps for context, below is a link to one of my early projects that I refactored recently:

- Repo: [https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher](https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher)
- The things I learned from it: [https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher/discussions/2](https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher/discussions/2)

I’m more interested in hearing from people who’ve seen this kind of work _in practice_.

Appreciate honest answers

Hey everyone,

I am 19 rn from india and I’m planning to transition into software development and want to make myself job-ready by the end of 2026.

Context:

No CS degree

Currently working full-time job(creative field)

I don’t even know the “C” of coding right now (complete beginner)

Can consistently dedicate ~5 hours daily for learning and building

Goal is to land a junior software / backend developer role

What I’m looking for:

A clear learning roadmap from zero → employable

How I should actually spend my time daily (learn vs build vs practice)

Which path is safest and most future-proof right now (backend, frontend, cloud, etc.)

Some more Questions:

Is it still realistic in 2026 to go from absolute beginner → employable in ~1 year with this time commitment?

Which path is safer / more future-proof right now (backend, frontend, mobile, cloud, etc.)?

How worried should I actually be about AI replacing junior developers in the next few years?

What kind of projects actually matter to employers vs what beginners usually waste time on?

If you were starting from zero today, what would you do differently?

I am hoping to learn from youtube, basically free sources. If you have any good source recommendations.

Any advice from people who’ve done this or hire developers would be appreciated.
Thanks.

You already got a lot of answers in your thread, but there is no way you will be employable in a year, especially since you work full time.

If you didn't work at all and were able to devote full time, 40+ hours a week consistently, you'll be lucky to be job ready in 4 years.

These days specializing won't get you a job, unless you're talking 8+ years. A _frontend_ or _backend_ or _cloud_ specialist is someone who's advanced on those topics. To get an entry level position you need to be well rounded with all of them.

AI is a tool for productivity, but it just means you need to be that much more well rounded and knowledgeable. The bar is much higher for what you can provide.

The projects that matter are professional grade CRUD apps that integrate everything - cloud microservices, CI/CD, containerization, testing, looks professional.

The _easy_ way to do it is get a 4 year degree, work your ass off, have internships, and then study applicable resources on top. The hard way is do it on your own but still takes 3-4 years of self study working your ass off. No offense, don't see a 19 year old knowing how to do that.

↳ **u/leixiaotie** (1 pts)

> How I should actually spend my time daily (learn vs build vs practice)

try to build a project, whatever it is. Calculator can be a good one.

AI, though controversional, can be a good (misleading) teacher. What you should do is asking AI to generate some code for a case you encounter (a small one, they sucks at big one). Make sure that it is running, then learn the code. Make some modifications yourself, or if you ask AI to do that, compare the new and old and see what changes to learn what part of code will do what. Repeat the loop until you are confident that you can read and debug the application by yourself.

> Which path is safer / more future-proof right now (backend, frontend, mobile, cloud, etc.)?

all are risky and I may be biased, but I'd say backend.

> How worried should I actually be about AI replacing junior developers in the next few years?

Very, but it just means that the entrypoint for "junior" will be increased with the help of AI. Both experience by learning with it and using it should improve one's skills better than today's junior.

> Is it still realistic in 2026 to go from absolute beginner → employable in \~1 year with this time commitment?

depends on one's talent and luck. as explained before, the entrypoint will be higher on top of old skills one's need to catch up like version controls. Never hurt to try if this is your passion, but if it's not, better think twice.

**u/unkerr\_** (1 pts)

I’m starting a lightweight CRM style pipeline for my job search because I keep losing track of follow ups and context.

Before I build too much, I want feedback on the UX and information architecture. High level goal: one place to capture opportunities, set a next action, and see a clean timeline.

If you’ve built dashboards or pipeline UIs:  
What should the default stages be  
What belongs on the opportunity detail page  
What’s the cleanest way to show timeline plus next action without clutter

    In this case it's really an actual new browser with an actual new engine.

    Slop or not, working or not, more browser engines popping up and the OSS community getting more and more foundations of various options will ultimately destroy chromium, webkit and gecko.

      It's not a browser, it's just slop mashed together. I saw someone claim that it can render pages in headless mode, I searched through the code and found out that it launched a headless Chrome instance.

It hurts me when people post about half baked projects call it "kinda works" and think they achieved something with it. Software quality is collapsing and people glorify this type of shit

NGL I'm all in for someone, anyone, to come and break the webkit\[chromium\]/gecko domination

All of the companies responsible for browsers today after such a long standing "shared monopoly" have devolved to either discutable practices or decaying compatibility, the only one that is still attempting to protect users is safari but the compatibility aspect didn't keep it.

If this sparks a new movements where we see 1000 of new actual browsers systems, I'm all in, I'm tired of these "safe/X/Y browsers" that are just chromium wrappers.

I don't want chrome to decide to **_not_** follow rules/standards and everyone being penalized and being forced to also **_not_** follow them because being chrome compatible is more important than respecting the web standard, this new movement could corner chromium into respecting standards _if_ it gets enough traction.

# If you were CEO of stackoverflow, how would you save this sinking ship ?

**r/webdev** • Posted by u/KeyProject2897 • 264 points
**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1qdvfzv/

I’ve been using it for years, and so has everyone else. But we all know times have changed.

Hypothetical question - if you were the CEO of this sinking ship, what steps would you take to save it?

1. Would you pivot completely and launch Stack AI which acts like any other AI.  
   or
2. May be launch an AaaS ? Agents as a service and provide solutions right inside VSCode or Cursor ?
3. Launch your own editor with focus on bug fixing ?  
   or  
   something else ?

What do you tihnk ?

You don't, you hire a CEO that's specialized in shutting down with the most money left at the end of the road

↳ **u/TheOnceAndFutureDoug** (229 pts)

This is the answer. I just wish they'd take the dataset and release it as a GNU license.

    ↳ **u/DDFoster96** (48 pts)

    Isn't the current CC BY-SA GPL-compatible?

      ↳ **u/Ash_Crow** (61 pts)

      Yes. But also it's already copyleft, no need to change license.

      I wish they'd transfer the brand and contents to a non-profit similar to the Wikimedia Foundation.

      ↳ **u/TheOnceAndFutureDoug** (11 pts)

      Honestly, no idea I'd need to look.

    ↳ **u/username-must-be-bet** (7 pts)

    Selling the dataset is how they shut down with the most money left at the end of the road.

    >  mean Reddit is still alive and well

    I’m only on desktop, and for as long as Old Reddit continues to be a thing. I absolutely refuse to use New Reddit as it is a user-hostile UI, and will finally bail if that becomes my only remaining option.

Yup. No point in maintaining the horse and carriage purely for nostalgia.

Didn’t they recently double revenue by monetizing their backlog of content to AI labs?

I think they’re doing fine as a company

↳ **u/Old-Stick-5542** (60 pts)

Yep - don't be fooled by the graph of user views / threads doing the rounds - they have already pivoted.

    ↳ **u/KeyProject2897** (5 pts)

    Interesting. Didn't know that. But is this scalable ? I think its one shot - take money and Exit plan no ?

↳ **u/RebelFist** (32 pts)

Yep, came here to say this. Most commenters seem unaware of this and confuse traffic with revenue.

    ↳ **u/loveofphysics** (28 pts)

    If content is your product and new content dries up, it will absolutely affect revenue

↳ **u/SystemGardener** (8 pts)

I did not know this! Very interesting, did they post it any place?

Also how valuable is that as a long term solution? Won’t most those companies have all the data they need relatively quickly and then won’t have to renew the agreement?

    ↳ **u/eldentings** (11 pts)

    Anecdotally, AI will recommend me deprecated solutions, especially with js frameworks that have a lot of syntax churn, or framework engine changes. I feel like it will only maintain it's value if questions continue to be asked and answered there.

      ↳ **u/powerfulsquid** (6 pts)

      This is 100% true. Shit will hit the fan eventually. Not sure when but the wall is definitely there. Then we will need to implement some crowdsourced input back to a model for continuous training to an LLM. That's my theory anyway, lol. 🤷‍♂️

    ↳ **u/xanez** (2 pts)

    The recent Decoder podcast interview with the Stack CEO was interesting and enlightening. They saw the writing on the wall and pivoted hard, and quickly. tl;dr \~\*\~\*enterprise\*\~\*\~

↳ **u/jaegernut** (3 pts)

If no one is asking questions anymore, there wont be new data to train the future AI on. Unless AI can somehow have the ability to learn new stuff by its own.

    ↳ **u/AUSTIN_NIMBY** (3 pts)

    I thought about this a lot. I think that the models will just tie into GitHub and other open source repos learn from that instead.

      ↳ **u/i_am_from_russia** (2 pts)

      what happens when most of the code in open source repos has been generated by the models

↳ **u/Velvet_thunder9** (2 pts)

Don’t understand, can you explain how they’re making money?

**u/niveknyc** (292 pts)

IMO there's so much value in a purpose driven focused community board where engineers help engineers solve problems, especially with the rise of AI there still needs to be a place for humans to ask new questions to other humans who have the experience. There just needs to be a better way to do it an a revenue model that makes sense.

↳ **u/el_diego** (146 pts)

This. Even if SO dies off, it'll be back in some new form in a year or so. We need resources like this otherwise we'll devolve into an AI circle jerk.

    ↳ **u/thatandyinhumboldt** (97 pts)

    This is one of my bigger concerns with AI:

    \> community builds a public knowledgebase
    \> AI ingests that knowledgebase and uses it to make intuitive leaps (whether they’re correct or not is another issue)
    \> those leaps are only available in conversations _that are private by default_
    \> community members use AI instead of the knowledgebase
    \> the knowledgebase shuts down, taking the knowledge with it
    \> …now what?

      ↳ **u/BakerXBL** (37 pts)

      Knowledge as a subscription of course


      Welcome to the technological dark ages.

        ↳ **u/thatandyinhumboldt** (21 pts)

        I mean that’s obviously the end game, but it seems _so_ self-defeating. We’re already hearing ai maintainers simultaneously say:
        - “we’ve ingested _the sum of human knowledge_ and we need more. Lots more.”
        - “we probably shouldn’t use AI-generated data to train the next generation of AI”
        - “we want to be the gatekeepers of all knowledge”

        I get that the end goal is enshittification, but it just seems so immediately unsustainable that I have to be missing something.

        And yes I’m aware that I’m literally the “old man yells at cloud meme” here.

        ↳ **u/doiveo** (7 pts)

        ding ding.  Context is king now.  Do managers trust organic contexts built organically by lowly devs or do they buy prepackaged contexts from MS/Oracle/Alphabet.

      ↳ **u/OuchieMaker** (3 pts)

      Logically having a way to search through existing knowledge, and then the ability to make posts on the forum for human interaction would be the best move. The problem is that the AI needs to not hallucinate and know when it doesn't know something instead of guessing. I think it can happen down the line but that would be the biggest issue.

      That, and people thinking their basic, dumb question about how to exit vim is so special that it deserves a human answer.

↳ **u/Puzzleheaded-Rip4058** (26 pts)

I wanted to like it but everything I posted got shot down. I would find answers myself after no one else helped and I figured it out and I posted the answer and relabeled it as KB since I answered it and I came back to it weeks later and it still got downvotes... comments get deleted for being dupes when they aren't. People just being toxic... I agree we need that knowledge but at least ChatGTP isn't an asshole to me.

    ↳ **u/Danny-Fr** (12 pts)

    That's what I wrote on another thread about SO.

    Users, on average, look for convenience over performance and it looks like being frustrated by a polite LLM beats finding a solution while peeling to yet another bunch of toxic layers.

    Too many people complain about GenAI while forgetting that, just maybe, generally being toxic assholes online and filling user-curated section with litter needs to be factored into why LLM use is so widespread.

      ↳ **u/Miniimac** (4 pts)

      Well, and LLMs respond in real-time. Big difference.

      ↳ **u/SplatDragon00** (2 pts)

      Either they lock your question because of an answer from years ago - follow up questions? Never heard of her! - or are *so rude* you wish they had

↳ **u/ghostsquad4** (2 pts)

Isn't that the idea behind public services?

↳ **u/lostPixels** (2 pts)

Why contribute though when the answers you spend time and energy on posting just get slurped up and reused by AI? There’s no incentive to post anything useful to such places right now because there are no controls for ethical AI usage and attribution.

↳ **u/that_mr_bean** (2 pts)

ya but that ain't gonna be SO. the CEO can shout into the wind all they want, it won't magically reverse decades of toxic community culture. it needs to shut down and be replaced by a new forum with new expectations

↳ **u/BewilderedAnus** (5 pts)

You're correct, but this is impossible at the moment. Such a board would be cluttered with non-english speakers, non-programmers (or extremely novice programmers), and morons all generating AI responses so that they can post alongside real engineers. There are currently so many issues with moderating that content.

↳ **u/Tucancancan** (1 pts)

Sooooo Quora 2.0?

↳ **u/saposapot** (1 pts)

I would love even more today for a place like that for experienced engineers. While it's quite easy to find places for beginner questions it's very hard to get good discussions with people with more knowledge and not having very beginner questions to bother.

It's not easy to discuss more advanced topics, architecture stuff, sharing bigger systems experience, experience with real products in production, etc. At least I haven't found a forum that caters for that niche, which is strange because I'm sure there are a lot of senior engineers around the world

↳ **u/Extension-Ice6221** (1 pts)

NGL. My experience there has always been negative. Took me forever to be able to contribute and ask questions to the point I noticed how much nose raising there was in there that it made me not even want to ask questions so I just stuck to google and books. Now with AI it basically answers me and doesn't have some ego complex if I ask a stupid question. I feel the vibe there killed it quite a bit before AI.

↳ **u/Biking_dude** (1 pts)

It's not the revenue model - it's the culture. People got rewarded for being hallway monitors so instead of having content experience they karma farmed policing.

**u/EnderMB** (27 pts)

Source: Despite not using it for years, I'm still in the top 1% of users. I joined during the initial beta, so know it really well.

IMO it can absolutely be saved, but it'll need a fundamental shift in how it works.

Back in around 2010 there was a push towards how SO handles the inevitable duplicate questions at scale. Some of us liked the idea of leaning into the wiki concept, and others wanted a single question. It's obvious which side won.

I'd go back, and reopen all closed duplicate questions. I'd push people towards answering with high quality answers, and would reward those that provide canonical and combined sources for questions - have them merge instead of close, but with two threads and a canonical "right" answer if they both apply.

From there I'd redo all the cool shit they used to be known for, real community shit with an updated feel, like:

- A yearly tech conference, with cheap tickets, solid speakers, and dates around the world.

- Lean into chat again, creating logs that can be cross-referenced. Maybe embed it into Discord, but with full logs that are then referenced via the site?

- Bring back the job board, but lower the costs and make it cheap for start-ups to post jobs. Maybe acquire LeetCode or build a competitor that people can use for hiring? I'd also lean into Pramp-esque video chat and videos to allow people to run mock interviews, learn about complex topics, etc.

- Open the platform to universities. Let them have private instances, and provide free accounts + benefits to CS students. Be the resource for students, so they continue to use after graduating.

**u/FishDawgX** (55 pts)

1. Start making deals with AI companies to allow them to (legally) train off stack overflow data
2. Severely cut people costs by stopping all new feature development and laying off staff.
3. Cut tech costs by simplifying the stack, turning off expensive features as needed, and migrating to the cheapest hosting option.

↳ **u/WebManufacturing** (23 pts)

This actually sounds pretty realistic. Step 0 might be to take drastic measures to prevent bots and data scraping - that's where any new development should be.

    ↳ **u/yousirnaime** (2 pts)

    Exactly - and sell the data with an api feed rather than the current scraping model. 

    Also: obfuscate the ui content to prevent (and make more expensive/inaccurate) the unapproved scrapers 

↳ **u/greenergarlic** (5 pts)

The problem is that no AI company will take this deal, since other publishers will immediately want a cut as well. Why pay for what you’re getting for free?

Cloudflare has been trying to get a pay-per-crawl API off the ground to do exactly this, and none of the chatbot companies have been willing to play ball. It’s just not in their interest to do so. 

    ↳ **u/yousirnaime** (7 pts)

    You do the deal by making the data processing less expensive from a raw server standpoint 

    The mechanical costs of having their scrapers vs just handing them a database is impactful enough that a deal could be made

    Especially if you engineer the ui to be harder for bots to ingest 

      ↳ **u/voidstarcpp** (2 pts)

**u/jawnstaymoose2** (4 pts)

So apparently founders already cashed out with a 1.8B buy out back in 2022 I think.

And there was the whole Mod strike over ai-generated content.

I’d say the community piece is gonzo, but regardless they reported a decent 2025 - 17% revenue growth and a break even year, after big losses in 2023.

They make $ from SO for teams, AI partnerships, jobs/ads.

Will any of that survive after loading the community piece? Probs not.

**u/loose_fruits** (6 pts)

You know what I’m not going to miss about stack overflow? Getting totally shut down for asking a question. I’m grateful for all it has done for my career, but any of the current generation of LLM’s are waaaaaay more helpful than stack overflow ever was. It’s time to bid farewell.

↳ **u/NotGoodSoftwareMaker** (5 pts)

Nah, the days before stack overflow were terrible. It was a godsend and then slowly became a place where no-one felt welcomed except the “in-crowd”

Turns out being unwelcoming to your users isnt a viable long term commercial strategy

↳ **u/UnicornBelieber** (5 pts)

The toxicity wasn't always a thing. A lot of has had a great learning experience on the site and contributed freely out of interest, the challenge and because we resonated with its goals. Not just "because we had to".

Jeff Atwood / Joel Spolsky both had very interesting things to say on their blogs and they both had a development background, they understood developers pretty well.

SO's/SE's goals and the manner in which they operate have changed though. My own enthusiasm dwindled when they sold to Prosus. I think that's what kicked off the whole commercialization of it all, including the firing of highly valued moderators/community managers.

Everyone else already trained off their data dumps and scraped any content not in them. Nothing to offer now.

    ↳ **u/Soccer_Vader** (7 pts)

    still stackoverflow is a familiar name in developer community, if they had created a chatbot(however bad), but marketed it specifically for developers, they would be over the moon with money, especially if they open investments, the VC money will flow in. Brand value goes a long way, and they just refused to do anything about it.

      ↳ **u/gradual_alzheimers** (5 pts)

      they could have partnered with claude in the creation of claude code and leveraged their brand when claude was trying to compete with Open AI for this.  I mean, the business strategy they fumbled is mind boggling.  Half of these comments are better than what stack actually did

      ↳ **u/Arch-by-the-way** (3 pts)

      They tried that and no one used it.

      https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/07/27/announcing-overflowai/

        ↳ **u/Soccer_Vader** (2 pts)

        That was proper shit. They should've just copied chatgpt model fo a chatbot, instead of answer/question pattern. The Overflow AI was also marketed as a feature+ to be used with stackoverflow.

        I am more thinking they could have done similar to what Stackblitz did with bolt.new

↳ **u/crazylikeajellyfish** (1 pts)

They can't compete on the compute, there's no point in trying to sell their own foundational model. The play is selling data, same as reddit.

**u/phantom_metallic** (6 pts)

It's time to let Stackoverflow go.

The gatekeeper won, and this is their "reward."

**u/PhilippStracker** (2 pts)

My strategy: archive StackOverflow (make it public/readonly) and start a new platform using all the code insights, where devs can take challenges and get a public skill rating/certificate. Companies have massive problems finding real talents from AI generated applications; an external platform that provides a baseline comparison based on real-world coding tasks would help devs find a job, and companies to hire the right people

**u/afops** (2 pts)

**u/p1971** (3 pts)

1. remove down voting

Let it end. Some things aren’t meant to last forever and StackOverflow is one of them. It’s also their fault that no one wants to use it anymore due to the more than hostile environment they fostered over the last however many years.

It was easy to predict the downfall, I used it a few times at uni then thought I'd post something.

**u/McWolke** (1 pts)

If So dies, AI won't be as useful anymore as well. Many of the more complex things it can do is because it can look information up in the Internet, including SO.

People hate on SO for how bad they treat people posting questions (and answers), but in the end it resulted in a cleaner experience for people who looked for existing questions/solutions. 
If they didn't shut down duplicate questions all the time, we would find thousands of the same thread with no answers. Instead, we find the one with the correct answer. 

**u/Fabulous-Farmer7474** (1 pts)

Well if I were the CEO and asked that question I would first berate whomever was asking it for it being not a good question (especially lacking a reproducible example) and then refer them to a link that describes how to ask a good question.

Once they reformulated their question in accordance with the accepted guidelines I would then close it as it represents an "already answered" question.

And if I did answer the question publicly then someone else would likely attack it as being wrong or dumb and then demand that their response be selected as "best response". So, in the end, offering a response would be pointless anyway.

**u/NCKBLZ** (1 pts)

I don't know but it would be useful if they offered ai answers for the common questions and then for specific ones let people help (and it should be real people and not people using ai) with in-depth answers backed by data. These people should be rewarded not just with useless upvotes but money

**u/onehalflightspeed** (1 pts)

AI was trained on SO. If SO goes away, what will train AI in the future?

**u/TheHidden001** (1 pts)

This is a hopeful response but making a really good search engine for it would be great. Back in the day I'd google things and find stack overflow threads that way, but SEO and search engines are garbage now so no matter how much I want to avoid AI, I end up using it because I just can't find relevant articles and information anymore. I don't think this would save the platform... I wish it would but AI is just ruining all good things. However I could see it as a way to maintain its users and grow slightly while developing their final exit strategy.

**u/pkief** (1 pts)

I would strengthen the Enterprise version of Stack Overflow. Companies do have lots of internal knowledge saved there which is not trained in a public LLM (because it's internal). If you improve the possibility to search with AI through that and retain the data privacy and the internal knowledge, it's still a great selling point.

Public Stack Overflow should still be continued to showcase their products and to be generally visible as a brand.

Sell the technology as a service. I remember that the infrastructure and architecture was really groundbreaking and they were able to serve so many page views on basically potatoes for peanuts.

**u/tswaters** (1 pts)

They have private books, no real way to know if the reduced views to the site is indicative of future bankruptcy.

For my two cents, focus on making the platform better. You can't control human behaviour unfortunately, but trying to rework the culture into something less toxic, where every answer & question is pointing at some semi-relevant answer from 5 years ago using ancient tech would be good.

One thing that SO has is not the SO site itself, but the sister sites where you have what appears to be actual experts in various fields providing insightful answers. I've seen the Linux, security, dba-specific ones -- but also the gaming and movie SO sites are usually quite good.

At the end of the day, you need to entice smart people to answer questions. It's ideal if those questions are HARD and you can get into the weeds that an LLM can only glaze around.

**u/recaffeinated** (1 pts)

Ban AI completely, stop selling our data, and try to attract back all the people they've alienated.

Tbh its probably too late

**u/letsjam_dot_dev** (1 pts)

Funny how the proposed solutions all revolve around AI. Not everything needs to be. SO has an issue with toxic moderation. And they have some reasons to back it up, like all forums. Good intentions but bad practices. Let's address this first.

Then if you don't want your web traffic to plumet, maybe stopping all the genAI to deflect users from actual web results is also a good start ?

**u/bonestamp** (1 pts)

Try to make a deal with at least one of the AI companies... they pay Stack to get access to the question/answer/feedback data, and the ability to post questions that fill holes in their data, maybe even some kind of chat/livestream to help direct deep think queues. They would also give Stack users (with above a certain number of points) free access to the AI model that they're helping train (that's what heavy users at reddit should get too honestly).

It's in the best interest of the AI companies to pay content sources, because if all of these content sources shut down, they're going to have to hire more people to help research and train the models. Not to mention, do we really want all of the real data to be hidden inside of these AI companies, or do we want that data to be at publicly visible sources like newspapers and other websites.

**u/copperfoxtech** (1 pts)

Maybe it is not up to StackOverflow but instead us. Maybe we start using it again, be less toxic, no dump AI code answers, and keep things human? We all know that AI is great at helping for many things and I am sure we all use it everyday. But if i had a community that was actually supportive I would go there vs here to find help from experienced people.

**u/Stein7Raiden** (1 pts)

**u/book-scorpion** (1 pts)

I would save it as some online archive. I don't know what's their budget, maybe try something different. Wikipedia says it's owned by "Prosus", a Dutch company that has many other things going so I guess it's gonna be fine

**u/kubrador** (1 pts)

lmao stack overflow isn't sinking, it's just irrelevant now that ai can answer "how do i center a div" in 0.3 seconds instead of waiting for some guy named kevin to tell you to use flexbox in 6 hours.

if i were ceo i'd lean into what makes stack overflow unique: the community validation system. launch a "verified solutions" product where you pay for ai-generated answers that are actually vetted by experienced devs before they hit your ide, like a human-in-the-loop filter. companies would pay for that because hallucinated code in production costs way more than a subscription.

the pivot to compete with chatgpt directly is a L move because you're not openai and never will be. but being the "trustworthy ai answers" layer? that's defensible.

**u/eneiner** (1 pts)

Has to be AI pivot to save the brand. Maybe AI aggregation service and they keep your history like other services. And extensions on top of that in code editors.

**u/MeltingDog** (1 pts)

Good question.

Putting aside AI the honest reason I don’t use SO that much anymore is because of the toxicity.

When I ask a question these days I pretty much assume that it will get downvoted. It’s almost like I have to “spend” reputation points to post questions.

I know they’re just meaningless magic internet points but it’s still disheartening, especially if you’ve put a lot of effort into writing a question with all the detail and examples of what you’ve already tried.

If I were CEO I’d try to tackle the toxicity. Maybe limit the ability to downvote to those above a certain level of reputation points. It would be a big challenge though.

Company I work at uses it as a documentation portal. The problem is that you have to stop colleagues from asking you directly and tell them to type it in there.

When they do do that though, it really helps us find similar problems which we can answer quickly and consistently.

Transition into stackipedia. Partner with them in an open source capacity with a specific donation fund aimed at Stack Overflow.

Transition the corporation into a multi stakeholder cooperative structure with a buyout from the users, workers, and an investor class that cares more about keeping Stack Overflow alive that straight profit.

**u/Federal-Ad-9230** (1 pts)

I’d like the new CEO to come out and yell “this isn’t AI slop, things here are written by humans”. Some humans might yell at you or belittle you but some might answer so creatively it would not just solve your problem, it would give you the ability to unlock something you never thought you could. And I really think some answers on SO do show you the mirror that you’ve skipped the fundamentals, or have made a wrong fundamental choice or something of the sort

The first day I got a cold call from stack overflow I was almost speechless. That business model was never going to work even before AI. 

They chased money by trying to make the company bigger than what it could support and now it's going to shrink until they can't pay for the servers anymore. 

**u/ShadowFox1987** (1 pts)

You don't try to save it.

Every competitor has already scrubbed it clean. It's like trying to save MySpace or Vine.

**u/Maple_Dogwood** (1 pts)

In addition to trying to make AI companies pay for data access for training purposes, I think SO should focus on two things: quality informative answers with deeper explanations, and niche issues specific to various platforms/languages/etc.

They can use AI to help moderate better/cheaper, and to flesh out explanations or identify answers that could use more explanation.

For niche issues, some forum like SO (or some other Stack Exchange) has to be the solution. When the new version of Mac OS doesn’t play nicely with your version of a python framework on your hardware and only a few other people in the world have sunk the hours in to troubleshoot that, a forum like SO is the best place for that content to hit the internet first.

**u/SuperZero11** (1 pts)

AI didn’t kill Stack Overflow, it killed unverified answers. SO’s comeback is becoming the "verification layer" for code. Don’t ship “Stack AI” as another chatbot, ship "Stack Verified": answers with repros, versions, diffs, and “works on X / fails on Y.”

Make answers decay unless reconfirmed so the best fixes stay fresh. Distribute via VSCode/Cursor/JetBrains plugins: detect the error + environment and surface verified fixes you can apply as a patch. Add bounties/escrow + maintainer payouts so real fixes get funded, not farmed for karma. In the AI era, the moat isn’t “more answers”, it’s trust + evidence + outcomes.

**u/LittleJC** (1 pts)

You don't. It's over.

**u/KeyProject2897** (1 pts)

As a founder, I don’t think “giving up” is ever really an option.

I’ve personally gone through multiple pivots on my own product (baloon.dev) - each time learning that the problem matters more than the original idea. And this in fact triggered this very question in my mind 😛

What finally clicked for me was narrowing the focus: instead of trying to replace everything, we turned it into a PM-first tool that helps product managers think, decide, and help them answers to questions related to their products in their companies using AI.

So may be - it can still take off for stackoverflow - They probably need a fresh brain - a new start up CEO who really wants to excel and not afraid of falling (coz they are falling anyways) 😂

**u/Awesan** (1 pts)

Double down on the archive and knowledge base aspect; add integrations or deals with forums or Discord to say "save to stack overflow" (using AI to clearly state the question and the answer). Make money by charging AI companies for training on your dataset. Or integrate with them to allow a fast search through your knowledge base to and allow them to link to answers as sources in an integrated way. This works for all the stack exchange sites as well.

Stop trying to be a community, get rid of all of the toxic community aspects like points and community moderation. And probably scale down the business significantly headcount wise.
