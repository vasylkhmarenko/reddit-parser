## 4. Comment Strategy

### Finding Relevant Threads
**Daily Monitoring Keywords:**

- "How do I," "struggling with," "can't manifest," "blocked"

**Prime Thread Types:**
- Technique troubleshooting questions
- Frustration/vent posts
- Success story comment sections
- Weekly discussion threads

### Response Templates

**For Desperation Posts:**
"I completely understand this feeling - I've been there. The desperation itself becomes the biggest block because it creates the exact opposite energy of what we're trying to manifest. Have you tried [specific technique]? I found that addressing the emotional state first made all the difference."

**For Technique Confusion:**
"This is such a common struggle. I went through years of technique-hopping before realizing the issue wasn't the technique itself, but how I was approaching it. [Specific insight]. What's your experience been with [relevant technique]?"

**For Authenticity Issues:**
"You've hit on something really important here. I noticed the same thing - you really can't fool your subconscious. For me, the breakthrough came when I stopped trying to force feelings and started working on [specific approach]. How do you typically work with getting into the right state?"

### Natural Product Mentions
**When Appropriate (10% of interactions):**
- After building rapport through multiple exchanges
- When directly relevant to solving their problem
- Always as additional resource, not primary solution
- Include disclaimer about it being your creation

**Example:**
"That's exactly the problem I was facing! I actually developed a systematic approach to this after struggling for so long. It focuses on [specific benefit relevant to their issue]. I can share more if you're interested, but honestly, the most important thing is [continue giving free value]."
