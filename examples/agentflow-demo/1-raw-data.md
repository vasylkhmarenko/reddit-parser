**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1q12o1k/

Due to a growing influx of questions on this topic, it has been decided to commit a monthly thread dedicated to this topic to reduce the number of repeat posts on this topic. These types of posts will no longer be allowed in the main thread.

Many of these questions are also addressed in the sub FAQ or may have been asked in [previous monthly career threads](/r/webdev/search?q=flair%3AMonthlyCareerThread&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=all).

Subs dedicated to these types of questions include [r/cscareerquestions](/r/cscareerquestions) for general and opened ended career questions and [r/learnprogramming](/r/learnprogramming) for early learning questions.

A general recommendation of topics to learn to become industry ready include:

- [HTML/CSS/JS Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/javascript-beginners-complete-tutorial)
- [Version control](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control)
- [Automation](https://blog.logrocket.com/tools-and-modern-workflow-for-front-end-developers-505c7227e917/)

I’m a fresh Computer Science graduate specializing in Data Science. I’ve spent the last year solo-building and maintaining a live product: a glamping resort booking platform and its internal management system.

I want to get a "vibe check" on my current skill level. Am I stuck in "Junior" territory because of my years of experience, or does the fact that I'm running a live business solo move the needle?

**The Credentials & Tech Stack:**

- **The Main Site:** Developed solo using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. Focused on SEO and performance (minification, lazy loading, asset compression).
- **Admin Portal :** Built a custom internal dashboard using **React** to manage resort operations, bookings, and data.
- **Backend & Logic:** I use **n8n** for workflow orchestration and **Supabase** for the database, Auth, and real-time updates.
- **AI Integration:** Developed **AI Agents via n8n and the Facebook Graph API** that handle the official FB page chatbot (automated inquiries, booking assistance, and lead gen).
- **Infrastructure & DevOps:** The entire project runs on **Docker containers** deployed on a **DigitalOcean Droplet**, managed via **Cloudflare** for DNS, SSL, and edge performance.

**My Workflow:** I essentially **vibe coded** the majority of the site and the React portal using **Antigravity** and **Copilot**. However, I manually revised, refactored, and debugged everything to ensure it actually works as intended. I chose **n8n** specifically because I work better with visual representations of data flows and logic, which allowed me to scale the backend and integrate multiple APIs much faster than writing custom boilerplate.

**My Questions:**

1. **Leveling:** In the 2026 market, where does "Solo Architect/Maintainer" put me?
2. **Job Fit:** Should I be looking for "Product Engineer," "Full-stack Developer," or "Automation Engineer" roles? I enjoy the "builder" aspect more than just grinding LeetCode.
3. **The Vibe Coding & Low-Code Stigma:** How do hiring managers view someone who uses AI and n8n to generate the bulk of the logic but handles 100% of the architectural decisions, containerization, and debugging?

Hi, I'm a junior webdev with some experience working on ongoing projects in front-end and back-end with VueJS and C# at my job. I'm interested in starting a personal project in the same vein as this site https://kisekidle.com/, but I don't have much experience in building an app from the ground up.

I would like some advice when it comes to choice of technology, hosting, building, deploying, and anything else that isn't just straight developing new features or fixing bugs that you might deem important to know about. Do you guys know any resource that covers these more fundamental aspects to a project, or a point to start? I really value good practice and modern standards, so I don't want to just pick up the first guide I see

And if anyone would have any idea what kind of technology/framework/language was used for the site I posted above that would be cool to know as well.

I’m a hybrid dev/designer (UI-heavy, performance/accessibility focused) trying to be intentional about my next skill jump.

I’ve spent years stitching together scheduling, task, and planning tools and keep running into the same friction points. I’m considering building a personal scheduling app as a long-term project — not as a startup bet, but as a deliberate way to grow skills and have something substantial on my resume.

Right now I’m learning React via the official docs. My uncertainty isn’t “React vs X” so much as:

- Is a scheduler a *good* project for skill growth, or a trap?
- How would you scope a v1 to avoid overengineering?
- What signals would tell you to continue investing vs pivoting?

I’m early enough that I can change direction if there’s a better learning path. Looking for honest feedback from people, thanks!

Outside of using WSL2 which links to my Ubuntu folder on my windows... what terminal do y'all use to access folders on the windows side of things, and not linux? Just figure I may need to use both, and recently all I've done is open WSL2 and use the linux side of things for storing projects..

Hello I'm currently applying for junior web developer positions.

My relevant work experience is a 6-month internship at a fairly good(for my country and the field standards) company. As of now in my CV I have included only this as work experience, skipping over all the temporary jobs I have worked in(barista,waiter,customer service,summer jobs etc etc).

Some people of my circle have advised me to include all of this in my CV since im 25 and it might come off as if I have been lazy in the past if I dont include it, which isnt the truth. But me personally I dont see why I should bloat my CV with irellevant work experience that doesnt show any of the skills required for the jobs im currently applying for.

Title: Service-based company intern: MERN vs DevOps — which path is safer long-term?

Hello everyone,

My brother is currently an intern at a service-based company. The company is offering interns two training paths:

MERN stack

DevOps

Important context:

He’ll be learning from scratch in the company

Internship duration: 6 months

After that, there’s an 18-month bond

This is a typical service-based setup (client projects, internal teams, etc.)

We’re trying to decide which option makes more sense for long-term career growth, especially considering:

Future job switching after the bond

Skill relevance in the next 5–10 years

Risk of getting stuck in low-growth roles

I’ve read mixed opinions:

Some say DevOps is high-paying but not beginner-friendly

Others say MERN gives stronger fundamentals and more exit options later

For people who’ve been in similar situations or work in service companies:

Which path would you recommend specifically for an intern/fresher?

Any regrets choosing DevOps or MERN early in your career?

How easy is it to switch roles after starting in either track?

Looking for honest, real-world advice. Thanks in advance!

For context ive been learning web dev for a few months now. And i have done html, css js and react with a few projects. Also been doing dsa along with it.  
Lately i've been coming across a lot of videos on youtube about how good the ai models are now. a few vids on opus 4.5, and i saw how with a little bit of back on forth you can generate a very good application (on the frontend at least). i meanwhile feel like shit when i realize my apps break because i didn't update state properly, or the tailwind on my components take hours to get right, its honestly very frustrating.  
I really don't know what should do? its like every month a new model drops and it shifts the goalpost father than the ground you cover.  
So i have some questions i want to know the answer of:  
how has ai affected the job? what were you doing before that you aren't now and vice versa?  
how do you see the role changing in the future?  
what can a person trying to get into web dev learn and do? are the things i'm supposed to learn still the same or are they/will they be obsolete?

↳ **u/Familiar-Dark8409** (1 pts)

i recommend building your first 2 projects without Ai  
 just so that you know how code works and how to know when Ai did something wrong

and than start using Ai model when building projects  
 tho you gotta build on your own at first to understand when Ai messes up otherwise when you are building new feature you will fall into the first shitty solution the ai gives you when you are building with it, there would properly be a better solution but just because you are not knowledgeable enough you wont catch it

you should be aware of what you are building either a whole new app or just a small task

Hello. I am a senior college student majoring in Computer information systems and wanted some advice. I was to start making websites for local businesses in my area to help my income as qell as gain experience working with others and applying their ideas. What do companies look for when purchasing a website? What should I have when I pitch this to a local business? How much should I charge? While I have made many sites for fun before, I am completly new to making website for raal businesses and want to make sure I am doing it right.

I’ve been learning JS by refactoring early projects into modular systems — what kind of real-world work does this mindset map to early on?

I’m ~4 months into learning programming seriously.

I didn’t start with “I want to be a frontend dev” — I started trying to build a SaaS, relied too much on AI, hit a wall, and realized I didn’t actually understand what I was shipping.

So I reset and focused on fundamentals.

Lately, I’ve been refactoring my early JavaScript projects with a heavy focus on:

- vanilla JS (no frameworks)
- modular architecture (engine vs UI vs state)
- separation of concerns

I’m very aware I’m still a beginner — I’m missing things like proper DSA depth, and I’m not claiming job-readiness.

What I’m genuinely trying to understand is:

> For people who work with JavaScript in production — where does this _style of thinking_ realistically show up early on (if it does at all)?

Not asking for portfolio reviews or job offers.  
I’m trying to calibrate expectations and decide what direction to lean into next.

If it helps for context, below is a link to one of my early projects that I refactored recently:

- Repo: [https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher](https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher)
- The things I learned from it: [https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher/discussions/2](https://github.com/ridd418/persona-matcher/discussions/2)

I’m more interested in hearing from people who’ve seen this kind of work _in practice_.

Appreciate honest answers

I'm kind of a noob in tech in general, but I've always been interested. I also would like to create a news site, with a focus on my areas local politics (I dislike my local news outlets lol) what skills do y'all recommend I learn for a news website, Im not looking for shortcuts or anything, I want to learn the skills and then apply them.

Hey everyone,

I am 19 rn from india and I’m planning to transition into software development and want to make myself job-ready by the end of 2026.

Context:

No CS degree

Currently working full-time job(creative field)

I don’t even know the “C” of coding right now (complete beginner)

Can consistently dedicate ~5 hours daily for learning and building

Goal is to land a junior software / backend developer role

What I’m looking for:

A clear learning roadmap from zero → employable

How I should actually spend my time daily (learn vs build vs practice)

Which path is safest and most future-proof right now (backend, frontend, cloud, etc.)

Some more Questions:

Is it still realistic in 2026 to go from absolute beginner → employable in ~1 year with this time commitment?

Which path is safer / more future-proof right now (backend, frontend, mobile, cloud, etc.)?

How worried should I actually be about AI replacing junior developers in the next few years?

What kind of projects actually matter to employers vs what beginners usually waste time on?

If you were starting from zero today, what would you do differently?

I am hoping to learn from youtube, basically free sources. If you have any good source recommendations.

Any advice from people who’ve done this or hire developers would be appreciated.
Thanks.

↳ **u/NICEMENTALHEALTHPAL** (1 pts)

You already got a lot of answers in your thread, but there is no way you will be employable in a year, especially since you work full time.

If you didn't work at all and were able to devote full time, 40+ hours a week consistently, you'll be lucky to be job ready in 4 years.

These days specializing won't get you a job, unless you're talking 8+ years. A _frontend_ or _backend_ or _cloud_ specialist is someone who's advanced on those topics. To get an entry level position you need to be well rounded with all of them.

AI is a tool for productivity, but it just means you need to be that much more well rounded and knowledgeable. The bar is much higher for what you can provide.

The projects that matter are professional grade CRUD apps that integrate everything - cloud microservices, CI/CD, containerization, testing, looks professional.

The _easy_ way to do it is get a 4 year degree, work your ass off, have internships, and then study applicable resources on top. The hard way is do it on your own but still takes 3-4 years of self study working your ass off. No offense, don't see a 19 year old knowing how to do that.

↳ **u/leixiaotie** (1 pts)

> How I should actually spend my time daily (learn vs build vs practice)

try to build a project, whatever it is. Calculator can be a good one.

AI, though controversional, can be a good (misleading) teacher. What you should do is asking AI to generate some code for a case you encounter (a small one, they sucks at big one). Make sure that it is running, then learn the code. Make some modifications yourself, or if you ask AI to do that, compare the new and old and see what changes to learn what part of code will do what. Repeat the loop until you are confident that you can read and debug the application by yourself.

> Which path is safer / more future-proof right now (backend, frontend, mobile, cloud, etc.)?

all are risky and I may be biased, but I'd say backend.

> How worried should I actually be about AI replacing junior developers in the next few years?

Very, but it just means that the entrypoint for "junior" will be increased with the help of AI. Both experience by learning with it and using it should improve one's skills better than today's junior.

> Is it still realistic in 2026 to go from absolute beginner → employable in \~1 year with this time commitment?

depends on one's talent and luck. as explained before, the entrypoint will be higher on top of old skills one's need to catch up like version controls. Never hurt to try if this is your passion, but if it's not, better think twice.

**u/unkerr\_** (1 pts)

I’m starting a lightweight CRM style pipeline for my job search because I keep losing track of follow ups and context.

Before I build too much, I want feedback on the UX and information architecture. High level goal: one place to capture opportunities, set a next action, and see a clean timeline.

If you’ve built dashboards or pipeline UIs:  
What should the default stages be  
What belongs on the opportunity detail page  
What’s the cleanest way to show timeline plus next action without clutter

I haven't implemented jQuery in a new project in 7 years or more. Modern JS can do all the things without being a dependency.

↳ **u/Roarke99** (34 pts)

Ditto. I'm on a 12+ yr old project, UI migrated from .Net MVC to Vue 2 8-9yrs ago and recently migrated from Vue 2 to 3. We have a ton of technical debt, but whenever I work on a component I remove jQuery and Lodash. Any new components are composition api and vanilla JS.

    yeah...  me too...  Vanilla JS is fine...  but jQuery was just so damn terse and convenient.

        const username = $("#username").val();

    ↳ **u/Fidodo** (1 pts)

    jQuery achieved the ultimate success. It was so good all its features were added to the standard library

↳ **u/Tontonsb** (26 pts)

JS was always able to do all the things, it's just about the amount of code that it requires.

I replace the jQuery with plain JS almost always when I touch files with it in nearly any project, but I have also noticed that `$(selector).click(callback)` is shorter and more ergonomic than

```
document
    .querySelectorAll(selector)
    .forEach(
        element => element.addEventListener('click', callback)
    )
```

and that `$('.mytable').on('click', '.somebutton', callback)` is more writable than `[native delegated event implementation that I have to look up every time]`.

    ↳ **u/deadwisdom** (23 pts)

    The real point of jQuery was to abstract away the differences between browsers (ie ie) but that’s no longer an issue. The ergonomic differences are so minimal. It doesn’t warrant another library and abstraction.

      ↳ **u/metty84** (11 pts)

      True. ‘forEach()‘ e.g. was introduced with ES6 in 2015. JQuery covered all the different implementations of the browsers and gave you one code to implement for all of them.
      That was very useful. But today, jQuery is just unnecessary.

      ↳ **u/packman61108** (1 pts)

      And IE is gone, so there’s no point in jQuery

    ↳ **u/eXtr3m0** (1 pts)

    When you include jQuery you deliver much more code then without.

      ↳ **u/packman61108** (2 pts)

      Debatable

↳ **u/pyeri** (6 pts)

Preference for terse syntax is a thing for some. I personally find jQuery-style APIs more readable and expressive for simple DOM manipulations, and I’m willing to pay the dependency cost for that ergonomics.

↳ **u/androidlust_ini** (2 pts)

Yeh, something like this.

It doesnt really matter - if it's fast enough and it works then who cares. Use it if you want. Just keep your vanilla js skills sharp.

↳ **u/tnnrk** (6 pts)

Yeah to me, it’s just syntactic sugar. Sure it’s a dependency but I believe there’s a smaller version of it available if that’s an issue. I don’t use it personally just because the current frameworks are better but I wouldn’t bash anyone using it just for scripting. The biggest thing is it’s just kinda redundant now that we have decent front end frameworks.

**u/MonsieurKnife** (13 pts)

COBOL and Fortran are still a thing. Jquery will be here another 30 years

↳ **u/ecky--ptang-zooboing** (1 pts)

Highly unlikely

**u/eobanb** (41 pts)

For better or for worse, yes, jQuery is still very much in common use. I probably wouldn't use it for a brand-new project, but I wouldn't be rushing to migrate existing sites/apps off of it either.

Also, depending on who you ask, some will also say there are still some things that are easier/simpler to do in jQuery than plain JS.

↳ **u/CaptainIncredible** (1 pts)

> there are still some things that are easier/simpler to do in jQuery than plain JS.

Yeah this. Which is less verbose to you?

const name = document.getElementById("name").value;

vs

const name = $("#name").val();

↳ **u/AyeMatey** (-23 pts)

Isn’t it mostly drop dead easy to migrate to plain vanilla JS, even via automated migration with an AI coding assistant?

I don’t do big projects but I’ve migrated ~10 smaller ones with Gemini CLI (yesterday I used antigravity) and it’s pretty fast. If you use ui widgets or icons or custom plugins it’s messier. But also doable.

    ↳ **u/krileon** (21 pts)

    Usually the problem is legacy systems that are utilizing several jQuery plugins not just that they wrote a few lines of jQuery that need to be replaced. Have to remember there's an entire plugin system built into jQuery that was heavily utilized for years.

      ↳ **u/AyeMatey** (-13 pts)

      Yep I’m aware

        ↳ **u/EducationalAd237** (2 pts)

        Lmao idk why you’re getting downvoted. We are upgrading frameworks and jquery refactor to TS is the least troublesome part of the job. This is a huge code monolith code base with different frameworks and utilizing a lot of jquery plugins

    ↳ **u/mr_jim_lahey** (11 pts)

    Everything is harder on big projects. Sure, you *could* use AI to migrate and it will *probably* be right (most of the time), but the effort to verify that it is *actually* correct - which is business-critical - is going to outweigh the benefits of migrating a lot of the time.

    Yes, an abstraction can do that

      ↳ **u/hawktron** (0 pts)

      Yes but the argument it’s trying to make is you don’t need it. As if less code isn’t still valuable now vanilla js can technically do it now.

**u/Merrick83** (39 pts)

Absolutely. I personally still use it, even knowing its a bit less efficient than plain JS now.

↳ **u/coolcosmos** (21 pts)

The efficiency different is irrelevant for 99% of use cases with modern processors.

I don't use jQuery since browsers have querySelector(), not because it's slow.

    The normal minified production version is 80kb: [https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js](https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.7.1.min.js)

**u/AintNoGodsUpHere** (5 pts)

My man. jQuery is more than half of the internet. Haha.

**u/ryandury** (15 pts)

Not really. An improvement to native javascript selectors (many years ago) more or less made jQuery irrelevant.

↳ **u/tribak** (19 pts)

Irrelevant, still massively used (around 70% of the web)

    ↳ **u/ryandury** (8 pts)

    Sure, I could have elaborated. It's still widely used, but probably because of legacy pages, articles or sites that haven't been updated.

    ↳ **u/Nerwesta** (3 pts)

    Most probably CMSes are the main culprit of such percentages.
    As an aside, OP's question is a bit tricky to answer, jQuery is definitely a thing ( per your %, I'm not feeling to double check ) but I assume the main point is who actively uses it, and who makes a new project with that.

    ↳ **u/followmarko** (2 pts)

    I'd imagine this number would plummet if wordpress got pushed out

↳ **u/BigBootyWholes** (10 pts)

I mean selectors are just a tiny portion of the utility. I haven’t done front end stuff in years, but on the backend when I am scraping HTML, jquery (cheerio) is supreme

↳ **u/Nerwesta** (3 pts)

Not only that, before the introduction of `fetch()` jQuery still had some sort of relevancy too. There are many examples like that, I forgot which website had a list with the relevant vanilla JS updates.

We could indeed cut to the chase and say ES6 made jQuery a far less obvious of a choice across the board.

    ↳ **u/ryandury** (1 pts)

    ah yes, i've already forgot about mr ajax()

↳ **u/ShawnyMcKnight** (2 pts)

QuerySelector really was a game changer and it’s mind blowing that didn’t come to JS much earlier.

↳ **u/saposapot** (1 pts)

I wouldn’t say irrelevant. While before jQuery was almost mandatory, now it’s not required anymore.

But it still provides much cleaner API than vanilla for most uses

**u/digital121hippie** (12 pts)

Every Wordpress site uses it

↳ **u/budd222** (11 pts)

Uses it is not really correct. WordPress ships with it, but it doesn't mean everyone actually uses it.

**u/AgsMydude** (5 pts)

Absolutely 

**u/txmail** (3 pts)

I am not elitists enough to make a bad face about using it, but personally I would only add it to a project if there was a library that required it.

99% of the time when I was using JQuery on projects I was just adding it because it made selectors way easier. Now that it is part of JavaScript I just use the built in.

**u/retro-mehl** (2 pts)

Use whatever works best for your project. But choose wisely.

**u/tbone80** (2 pts)

[ASP.NET](http://ASP.NET) Core projects are still using it by default for client-side validation.

**u/SALD0S** (2 pts)

Fits like a glove in some projects, and jquery long term support is one of the longest out there.

But it was more relevant during internet explorer days .. nowadays browsers are more standardised

**u/KontoOficjalneMR** (2 pts)

One word: Plugins.

If you have a plugin that relies on jQuery - you will add jQuery. Because ... why not? It doesn't pollute namespace, speed penalty is irrelevant. And API is familiar to anyone who worked on a frontend in the last decade or two.

**u/rmxg** (2 pts)

Yes we still use it occasionally at our company for older projects that we're adding features to, but not for new projects.

**u/iComeInPeices** (2 pts)

Very much so, albeit mostly old and lazy setups… looking at you Wordpress themes I get requested to adjust!

**u/robin_3850** (2 pts)

jQuery is definitely still around but its more in maintenance mode than active development. I havent started a new project with it in years. The main reason is that modern vanilla JavaScript has caught up to what jQuery made easy. Things like querySelector document.getElementById and fetch make DOM manipulation and API calls straightforward without needing a library.

That said theres still tons of legacy code out there using jQuery and if youre working on an older codebase youll definitely encounter it. Some WordPress themes and plugins still rely heavily on it. For new projects though most teams have moved to modern frameworks or just vanilla JS. The browser APIs are so much better now that the abstraction jQuery provided isnt as necessary.

If youre learning web dev I wouldnt prioritize jQuery. Focus on understanding vanilla JavaScript first and then pick up a modern framework like React or Vue. Youll pick up jQuery quickly if you ever need it since its just a simpler API wrapper around the DOM.

**u/Gloomy-Status-9258** (2 pts)

if your company uses it, then use it. otherwise, there is no reason to use it.

**u/strange_username58** (4 pts)

Yes

**u/jambalaya004** (3 pts)

Google app scripts recommends it in their docs still lol

**u/karlmarxsw** (2 pts)

well, considering it's downloaded 17 million times a week and the trendlines is increasing, not decreasing, I think it's definitely still a thing.

**u/pravchuk** (2 pts)

If your AI IDE doesn't pick it, you shouldn't either.

**u/PhilippStracker** (1 pts)

There’s no need for it in modern codebases. Vanilla JS is very efficient and already, and the problems that jQuery solves can be solved more elegantly without jQuery.

I don’t recommend using it anymore

↳ **u/Tontonsb** (3 pts)

Depends on what you mean by "more elegantly" as I enjoy some of the perceived transparency that a native JS implementation, but it's not always shorter or easier. For one, the issue with `.querySelectorAll` is that it returns a NodeList and requires additional spread acrobatics before you can apply array methods to it.

https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1qewmy6/comment/o01if53/

When working in a project where jQuery is already added it seems important to know both these days — you should realize you can do `button.disabled = true` without wrapping it in jQuery, but you should also know when to take advantage of their implementation of some trickier tasks like `.on` does.

**u/Dr\_\_Wrong** (1 pts)

My company doesn't use it for new work, but we have legacy code that uses it.

**u/fredy31** (1 pts)

Does it still exist? Yes.

But the patch it was filling is gone. Javascript now reacts the same 99% of the time across browsers.

When i started 12 years ago you still had to support ie 6-7 that decided they didnt want to follow the norms and you had to do js a special way just for them

**u/avanti8** (1 pts)

I doubt anyone's spinning up any new projects with it, but it's in some of our legacy ones.

**u/Milky_Finger** (1 pts)

Hot take but some jQuery sites pretty much used it for things like selecting an element and hiding it on a toggle (show() and hide() and toggle() ). So now people don't do it this way and actually code a class in properly.

**u/CantaloupeCamper** (1 pts)

I’m in an old codebase with JQuery every day.

It’s not bad….

I don’t use it for anything new but I maintain it.

**u/MathAndMirth** (1 pts)

Pretty much nobody uses it for new projects. Just about everything that it did is now either no longer necessary due to better browser standardization, or better handled by other libraries/frameworks.

However, there is still an awful lot of legacy code out there that uses jQuery. So it's hard to say that it isn't relevant. But it's not surprising if v4 is not a big priority. What is there in jQuery3 that still works so badly that it cries out for an upgrade just for the sake of legacy code?

**u/shgysk8zer0** (1 pts)

It still makes syntax of some things easier, usually just by saving s loop. On the other hand it's diverged from native JS in many ways and the jQuery methods might be entirely unrelated to new element methods.

I still occasionally use something jQuery-like that I wrote. It's designed to be more modern and to be tree-shaken, so it's a module that exports functions instead of a class. `on('.selector', event => ...)`. It's basically just simple wrapper functions over `[...base.querySelectorAll()]`. I think such a simple library is more than a replacement (upgrade in many cases), more modern, and lighter.

On the other hand, many sites, especially legacy and WordPress, still use/include jQuery. It's still a thing, just in a legacy way.

**u/ninjabreath** (1 pts)

sometimes for really lightweight php pages if i dont feel like using the angularJS mini

**u/Miragecraft** (1 pts)

It's still useful if you have mostly static/server-rendered site with only a dash of animation and/or interactivity.

These types of sites are relatively rare, but they still exists - personal blogs, small business etc.

If you want to do more though jQuery starts to get in your way.

**u/Temporary_Oil_4970** (1 pts)

Pretty sure it’s used on just about every WordPress site, so yes

**u/JeffTS** (1 pts)

For what it's worth, WordPress, Joomla, and other CMS still ship with it. Drupal 8 and 9 still shipped with it too; Drupal 10 does not. Magento as well, I believe.

**u/snipsuper415** (1 pts)

if it has been adopted by a big industry, expect it to last decades... just look at cobol and fortran. They are still used in some places

**u/my_hot_wife_is_hot** (1 pts)

20 years ago…. Before jquery there was a combo of Scriptaculous and Prototype.js. The code I wrote in that is still running at the old company I used to work at, because they hired this idiotic vp who insisted that they switch our business system to SalesFarce, they spent 5 years and a crap ton of money, pushed all of my team and myself out the door, only to pull the plug on salesfarce and continue using my scriptaculous/prototype.js front end (php backend) with no one left who knew how it works. They also fired that VP. He also had said coders were obsolete.

It's mostly a convenience wrapper these days.

**u/WorriedGiraffe2793** (1 pts)

Yes very much.

**u/Mestyo** (1 pts)

It's still a thing, but it shouldn't be.

There was a few years around 2010 when it was genuinely useful, as it bridged feature gaps and normalized differences between browsers.

Since then, people only use it out of familiarity.

**u/oosacker** (1 pts)

My company took on a project where another company removed Vue and replaced with jQuery

Then we re-added Vue...

**u/White_C4** (1 pts)

Yes, but mostly for old websites.

**u/mookman288** (1 pts)

I still use jQuery for my personal projects and for projects where I think it would benefit the use. The abstraction it provides is still much better than plain JavaScript and far more intuitive.

There's obviously no need for a React build or a Laravel build that uses livewire.

For static sites, which I build for small businesses, I do everything in plain JS because it reduces the page load significantly and I try not to encourage my clients in that space to depend heavily on JavaScript interactions. I go out of my way to squeeze every kb in images too. The demographics for static sites require CTAs and information to be present immediately and without animations for higher conversion rates. You'll know what I mean if you've had to find and vet a contractor, plumber, or other local service provider before.

**u/saposapot** (1 pts)

Define being a thing.

Is it still widely used in a huge number of websites? Certainly yes.

Does it make sense to use a new project? Depends.

If you are using a framework definitely not. If you are not using a framework I still argue jQuery presents a nicer API to use instead of vanilla JS. I don’t really see the drawback of using it.

Yes, nowadays you don’t need jQuery but, for me, it still is nicer to use instead of vanilla with a negligible performance hit.

If you don’t know jQuery should you care to learn? Maybe not.

But just because it’s out of fashion doesn’t mean it’s dead or crap.

Also, not having a lot of releases being done doesn’t mean much. It just means it’s feature set is practically complete and authors don’t want to add much more, just improve on what they have. They still fix security issues. And that is perfectly fine. Old doesn’t mean outdated the same way new doesn’t mean better per se.

**u/justhatcarrot** (1 pts)

jquery's still alive in legacy projects but basically dead for anything new. as for v4, it's in the same limbo as half-life 3 at this point, announced, promised, never arriving. it's still here though, mostly haunting wordpress installs and that one project nobody wants to maintain.

**u/altviewdelete** (0 pts)

Can't speak for it's current state, but I used it 20 years ago and it made a lot of things easier, by being a wrapper over writing a lot of complex(ish) JS functionality.

After a few years though (back then) it became unnecessary and more of a bloat.

↳ **u/heavenlydemonicdev** (42 pts)

Cloudflare is kinda different, they sponsor so many open source projects and as stated by the announcement post this removes the burden of creating a sustainable business model from the Astro devs shoulders which means more time and effort put into building a better Astro.

      It's true no company is a saint but credit is given when its deserved, they offer a good product and the most generous free tier out there so if there's a company I'm going to give my money to it's going to be them instead of their competitors.

      Tho if there are any negative things about them please share them as I'm not aware of them and would appreciate knowing them.

        ↳ **u/Scared-Gazelle659** (6 pts)

        Oh I also use Cloudflare with pleasure. But I'd prefer them not to have perverse incentives wrt other tools. 


        They're not doing this out of the goodness of their hearts, or even if they are it won't last forever. And now the goals of the Astro project will forever be swayed by what is best for Cloudflare. Not what is best for a web framework. Those things might align now, but for how long...


        That's why I prefer for projects to remain as independent as possible.


        I don't want to be locked into a webhost because they have the best framework.


        I want to pick the best framework and use it on the host I deem most suitable. And this applies to all technologies/projects/frameworks.

**u/Radiant_Garage5703** (7 pts)

This is interesting timing. Cloudflare has been building out their edge compute platform pretty aggressively, and Astro fits nicely into that ecosystem. From a developer perspective, it could mean better DX for deploying Astro sites to Cloudflare Workers/Pages with less config overhead.

That said, I do worry a bit about vendor lock-in. One of Astro's strengths has been being relatively platform-agnostic - you can deploy it anywhere. Hopefully they maintain that philosophy even under Cloudflare.

Will be watching to see if this leads to any Astro-specific optimizations on Cloudflare's platform that aren't available elsewhere. That would be the first sign of things getting too coupled.

They've been a pretty good sponsor/steward of their other projects and keeping it open for everyone to use, like Hono and TanStack. I think it's because their bottom line comes from their "enterprisey" products.

I fear this will turn out like how Netlify bought GatsbyJS and then let go of the whole team and stopped upgrading and supporting Gatsby. It became a feature for marketing that they essentially abandoned. 😔

↳ **u/EmmaTheFemma94** (3 pts)

Cloudflare seems to focus on getting money for services related to hosting etc. I think their plan is to try and make it easy to build and use their platform for free. Then as you grow you need services they provide.

So I really hope they will just try and keep Astro great. If Astro is getting shittified then I would just use Eleventy with Vite.

**u/danielwarddev** (1 pts)

On one hand, different tools converging under one parent is generally not a good thing for the consumer. On the other hand, Cloudflare seems to have been generally pretty great so far, and how aggressively they're trying to (presumably) be a loss leader with the pricing on their cloud services HAS been a good thing for the consumer.

I would also guess that many (most?) people using Astro are putting it on Cloudflare, anyway.

**u/robin_3850** (1 pts)

This is actually pretty significant for the Astro ecosystem. Cloudflare has been making really smart moves lately with their developer tools and this acquisition gives Astro the resources and infrastructure to scale properly.

What I find interesting is the timing. Astro has been gaining a ton of momentum as the go to framework for content heavy sites that need to be fast. Cloudflare obviously sees value in owning that space especially with their Pages platform competing directly with Vercel and Netlify.

The real question is whether Astro will stay framework agnostic or if theyll start pushing deeper Cloudflare integration. One of Astros strengths has been that you can use it with React Vue Svelte whatever and deploy anywhere. If they start optimizing specifically for Cloudflare Workers or Pages that could be great for performance but might alienate people who want to deploy elsewhere.

On the positive side Cloudflare has a pretty good track record of keeping their acquisitions open and community focused. Wrangler and Workers are still usable outside the Cloudflare ecosystem so hopefully Astro stays similarly flexible. Plus having Cloudflares resources behind it means better docs faster bug fixes and potentially some really interesting performance optimizations at the edge.

Overall this feels like a win for both sides but time will tell if it stays true to what made Astro appealing in the first place.

**u/semmu** (1 pts)

yeah, now its just a matter of time before astro gets heavily vendor-locked into cloudflare, then some time after we will have some libreastro/openastro fork or whatever.

keep your content separate. then you are fine. here are two websites, one nextjs+vercel other astro+cloudflare. using same headless backend -

Interesting move. Cloudflare’s edge network + Astro’s performance-first approach feels like a natural fit. Curious how this will impact SSR and edge rendering going forward

# Don't join startup companies without proper research, make sure you talk to employees who work there.

**r/webdev** • Posted by u/Rare-Chicken-53 • 17 points
**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1qf61bh/

I want to share an honest experience here so you guys can avoid this and do proper research about companies beforehand. This is my and others combined experience regarding this organisation.

The company is run by a single person with around 12-15 employees. Its a startup so not a lot of expectations but some things are straight out bizzare.

Work Culture context:

- Monday to Saturday working
- 10 to 7:30 (almost everyday stretching upto 8:00 - 8:30 minimum)
- Saturday (10 to 4:00) stretching upto 4:30 - 5:00 sometimes
- Its a 2 BHK room as a workplace
- No seperate washrooms for boys and girls
- No mirror in washroom etc.

When you join it seems fine for a few days but after a week or two things get worse for you, for example:

1. Every single day the working hours stretches upto 8 - 8:30 because the owner here likes to review the work we are doing, it feels like he purposely comes out late from his room most often after 7:30 - 7:45 and then reviews work one by one talking to each of the employee, till our time comes he expects us to wait in the office itself until review is done, and also we need to add daily status email and fill in gitlab on top of this unnecessary review.

2. Sometimes work is assigned in second half of the day and that needs to be done the same day making it hard for us to leave on time, even if the client might have sent the email and stuff 2-3 days back the employees here recieve it at the last moment expecting it to be done.

3. There are very less people around 12-15 employees only, and here most of only freshers fresh out of college are being hired, the old employees either leave once they recieve their bonus because of the working conditions or are being fired for wierd reasons. 

4. I have also noticed once the new employees the freshers get hired the owner kind of stops speaking softly with the old employees, and finds more problems in the work or anything else as he have someone else now as replacements.

5. The employees here are not supposed to chat or have a laugh in the morning hours, or in afternoon and stuff like that, then the employees recieve emails regarding behaviour and code of conduct saying what is acceptable and what is not.

6. One incident where a guy was fired because he was sick and instead of calling the owner on phone to ask for leave he just put in a email taking sick leave (like in normal companies this is absolutely acceptable), but here the owner fired him because of that reason and then later called everyone in his office to say that you are supposed to call on phone for leaves otherwise strict action will be taken like this and other similar stuff.

7. Also the owner expects you to be on time in the morning, if you are late for 3 days in a month even if you are waiting till late hours then too your 1 day salary will be deducted, even if you have to wait late upto 8 - 8:15 that is not considered.

8. There is grace period for arrival given of 15 - 30 mins so you can come upto 10:30 after that it will be considered as half day. Everytime the rules change sometimes its half day after 2:00 sometimes its at 11:00 and what not, it gets wierd.

9. There are no seperate washrooms for girls and the boys, there is no mirror in the washroom to look into, we need to look up in the showers head reflection to fix ourselves, and definitely its worse for the girls because of that.

10. For developers its much more worse, there is one senior guy (the only senior guy) who writes his entire code using ChatGPT, and later acts like how his work finished in a few hours and why others take so much time, later other developers have to debug that code cause he broke the functionality built by other developers, when asked he will say "Chotasa hi fix hai, mereko kam hai, khud karo (Its a small fix, I am busy so do it yourself)". And he is like the owners favourite because he delivers his job fast but causing others to spent more time to fix it for him and no one can't even complain.

And Honestly thats not everything, there is no proper management of anything at all, there are no proper coding standards, no proper documentations to refer, no proper code reviews, no proper testing - if it works and does not break then ship it thats all. The codebase looks like mess, there is so much redundancy and single files having 9k-10k lines of code and functions instead of seperating them.

The problem is most of the people working here are freshers, hence they don't say anything about all this stuff. They need to have that job in order to keep family happy. But leaving late everyday, overworking and burnout is real. I have also see that the people joining here mostly abandon the job within the few months or days itself else are stuck because of family issues and 90 days of notice period.

Also the issue is the old employees who worked here or were here have not added reviews on platforms like glassdoor or ambition box at all. And I cannot say much here cause there are so less people already in the office so I can only state the most generic stuff here.

I have read horrible stuff on reddit here regarding jobs, some might say that this is normal in IT companies but I wanted to share this for freshers as the hiring might start sometime later.

I suggest all of the freshers and people who are searching for a job to first review the company properly no matter what, try to connect with old employees to ask them why they left, or connect with working employee to understand the culture cause in the long term it is going to matter.

Also a request to people to leave honest reviews about workplaces so it can help avoid falling into this again.

Company Name: **SaffireTech** (Mumbai, India)

# How to shake off constant fear of being devaluated or replaced by AI

**r/webdev** • Posted by u/alexbessedonato • 52 points
**URL:** https://reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/1qesxyd/

I know it’s unhealthy. But I just can’t stop myself from scrolling and reading info to find out whether AI will replace a Frontend Junior with 1YOE like me… whether I’ll have a job in 5 years… wether my degree and effort will be worth it…

I just keep doomscrolling and doomscrolling because I feel if I miss any bit of news I’ll be left behind and as I’ve read everywhere (the best will thrive the average will be replaced)

How can I find peace of mind in this time?

## Comments (52)

**u/OhNoItsMyOtherFace** (64 pts)

I've got 15+ years in this kind of development. The issue is not that AI will actually replace you, it's that decision makers THINK it will so they've stopped hiring juniors.

This isn't good for you and it's also not good for me. Experienced developers don't just sprout out of the ground, they all start off as juniors. I'm not sure what these corporations think is going to happen as more and more senior people retire and there's no one coming up behind them.

Just keep going, expanding your knowledge, etc.

↳ **u/svvnguy** (16 pts)

Nobody thinks that long term anymore. They're happy to make bank **now**.

Companies hired juniors because they were useful (seniors needed them). Now that the average junior can be replaced by AI, companies have no incentive to pay that salary when they can just pay for a $20 subscription.

    ↳ **u/InevitableView2975** (6 pts)

    i mean can we be really replaced? i try to use ai in our react 17 code base and most of the time it gives shit code, i just use it to check if i can implement something in other way or to get naming ideas.

      ↳ **u/svvnguy** (3 pts)

      I remember when I was begging my boss to hire more juniors because there was a lot of non-essential code to write. I think that situation comes up a lot less these days.

**u/magenta_placenta** (17 pts)

The first thing you need to realize is that doomscrolling amplifies anxiety and is going to make future outcomes seem binary (replace or survive) rather than gradual and controllable.

Next, look to build defensible skills _with_ AI. Leverage AI as a teammate, deepen your core frontend fundamentals (architecture, performance, accessibility, etc.) and learn how AI can augment, _not replace_, your work.

**u/Crazy-Age1423** (10 pts)

By gaining knowledge so that the AI starts to work for you instead of you. First, you gain knowledge about the topic. And then you understand how to make AI work for you.

So that, when you go to a potential employer you say - I can use this and this and this AI program, I have these kind of skills with them and have made AI my slave. But only I have this valuable knowledge, so you need me to operate it.

You need to make them understand, that you offer quality AND quantity.

Cause any bufoon can prompt AI for a glitchy frontend without knowledge of how it actually should all go together. However, YOU can actually make something of value.

**u/webdev-dreamer** (6 pts)

I'm surprised no one has mentioned learning software architecture, design patterns, database design, fullstack, etc.

It's a bit silly nowadays to just be a "frontend" dev, no? You gotta be like frontend, backend, infra, security, etc.

I imagine that's the main way to increase your value and job security

**u/Opposite_Patience485** (19 pts)

Doomscrolling isn’t going to help. Frontend juniors are falling out of demand; that’s reality & not looking to change soon. So, what can help is learning the skills to AI-proof your career. Take digital courses in AI agents, ML, cloud or cybersecurity. Or go the freelance route if you prefer to stick with web dev, that’s something you can do while keeping your current job. Can be applicable to digital marketing, or you could look into project management. Think about how the skills you do have can be transferred & what other skills you’d like to build upon.

↳ **u/alexbessedonato** (5 pts)

All of those are like completely separate fields… some even different uni degrees… I’m not saying it might not be the best/only route but it does feel like starting all over again just for a chance to be safer from AI. And maybe I take cybersecurity course and by the time I complete it and do a couple projects and find a job AI takes that too lmao

    ↳ **u/Opposite_Patience485** (5 pts)

    Learning to use AI agents isn’t a completely separate field; neither is learning to do cloud deployments. I know bc I’ve been a front end dev for the past 5 years. Cybersecurity, AI, cloud concepts are all applicable to building web apps. You don’t need to specialize master level in all these but learning the basics will improve your skillset & resume. OWASP top 10, working with OAuth & MFA, encrypting & decrypting data are cybersecurity basics & help with web dev. Integrating with AWS or Azure is something software teams do in many large corps so aiming for a the basic cert is going to be helpful & attractive for your resume. Knowing how to use AI to assist with your coding work, knowing how to work with agents, are all things that will make you appear more attractive to companies. It’s not doing the same exact thing that you’re used to but you do this work long enough & you will be asked to learn about & step into these other areas eventually.

    If you didn’t want to have to learn new things & just wanted what you learned for your degree to be enough, then tech wasn’t the right pick. Technologies constantly change & evolve. You either learn how to use them & adapt or you fall behind. Regardless, endless doomscrolling & telling yourself you can’t do it is not going to help with anything 🤷🏻‍♀️

    You shake it off by staying curious & willing to learn & try new things.

    ↳ **u/RareDestroyer8** (2 pts)

    Try full stack development

↳ **u/-Ch4s3-** (6 pts)

Courses in AWS/Azure will definitely deliver in demand skills, as will cybersecurity training and I think both are worthwhile. I’m skeptical that any AI courses are teaching anyone anything useful at the moment, you’d get more by just using agents to build some stuff, IMO.

**u/Feeling_Photograph_5** (3 pts)

The Stoics had this idea called the Dichotomy of Control. The world is mostly things you cannot control, such as the direction of the tech industry. These things are not your concern.

There are a few things you can control however. For example, it is your choice whether or not to start doom scrolling on your phone. That's a waste of time for pretty much everyone, but it sounds like it comes with a side of anxiety for you, so do something about the behavior itself. Put your phone in another room if you have to.

As far as your skill set, you need to start looking at AI as a tool. What do you know about AI Engineering? If it isn't much, get a copy of Chip Huyen's book "AI Engineering" and read it cover to cover. Go to Udemy and get a course on AI Engineering. It should cover topics like RAG and MCP. Get on it. Learn everything you can.

Have you learned to integrate AI workflows? Check out what Boris Cherney is doing with Claude Code, it's incredible.

Web development is changing really fast and managers and CEOs want a new breed of engineers who can use the powerful tools available to them today to deliver what used to take entire teams. Learn to do that, and you're going to have a great career.

Waste time on your phone and the moment will pass you by.

It's up to you. Control what you can. Give it your full attention. Don't spend time thinking about the rest.

**u/AlexBossov** (5 pts)

Bro, everything will be fine, just start immersing yourself in AI, every company will need people who will give instructions for AI, plus one year of experience is already middle- not just jun, keep working with an emphasis on AI and everything will be fine, I believe in you

**u/Stargazer\_\_2893** (5 pts)

I work with AI every day, both as a tool to develop and as a product. It's great. It's not replacing me. Even with all the prompts I've written and all the experience it has with me curbing its worst behaviors, it still goes in wild directions and writes massively overcomplicated files, especially the advanced models like 5.2 Pro.

Anyone who tries to replace devs with this is in for a bad time.

5 years into the age of automobiles they were also pretty shitty. The horse was much faster and more economical. It even had autopilot! Cars were a novelty. Well, look where we are now. An engineer of all people should see the writing on the wall, the world very well may be unrecognizable by the end of the decade.

    ↳ **u/92fordtaurus** (3 pts)

    Yeah that’s my fear too. Just a few years ago ai was total garbage at coding and now it’s pretty solid at many things. We don’t know when it will plateau but I’ve already come from one industry that was mostly phased out of relevance due to emerging technology that I can’t help but worry about it. Thing is, ai is so big that if it reaches that point it’s going to fuck things up so thoroughly that there’s really no point in trying to pivot if you’re already in the field. Just ride it out and hope for the best.

It won't replace anyone by itself but it leveled the playing field a lot, especially for juniors, it's not just a tool it's mandatory, you can't have junior devs coding by hand at 5% the speed of AI for thousands of hours until they get good.

Very simple. Use Windows. Its full of shit. Its made by one of the biggest companies and backers of AI.

Infact the vast majority of tools and software that these companies put out is a vibe coded shit, full of bugs and vulnerabilities. Do you think the react vulnerability wasnt because of some vibe coding?

How can someone say to people that they will be replaced by AI and then cant even fix their own vibe coded shit.

So just become good at what you do i would say.

Also, something my manager said years ago is that we don't hire front end or back end engineers. We hire someone and expect them to do both sides.

**u/Beginning-Comedian-2** (4 pts)

Do productive work with AI every day.

This will give you a sense of what it can and can't do.

As the saying goes...

"AI won't replace devs. But a dev who uses AI will."

Bottom line: stop thinking of yourself as web dev or coder. Start thinking of yourself as a business problem solver. Code is a tool. AI is a tool. etc.

Your doomscrolling is about finding out about what others are doing with AI. Some of that time would be better spent using AI. Part of using AI effectively involves improving the local AI system in your repos. Finding out how it's possible to control AI using [AGENTS.md](http://AGENTS.md) files as well as a number of other parts of systems like Copilot.

Your doomscrolling is not useless at least. As you have picked up some knowledge, some of it will be useful when it comes to getting things done using AI.

**u/wickedwise69** (1 pts)

Eventually AI will get good enough to replace pretty much 60 to 70% of the developers. It's not there yet, learn to adapt. Learn how to use AI in your development process. People said AI will not be that good and same people are coding using AI.

**u/Christavito** (1 pts)

If front end to you means using react to build an okay website, then you will probably be replaced. You can probably be replaced already.

I do a lot of front end work and it involves complex integrations between micro FEs using things like module federation, optimizing network requests and caching, making sure certain accessibility standards are being met. I can debug deployed code for issues that don't happen locally or in test environments.

I do a lot of work AI can't do, like following up on tasks that require other teams (marketing, business, networking, B&D), providing tech demos and explaining limitations in words non tech people can understand. I push tasks that may have fallen through the cracks, I consider side effects of implementations and edge cases.

I can and do use UI to write a bit of the code, but there is so much required of a developer besides writing code that I am not worried for a while.

**u/ijbinyij** (1 pts)

Sooner or later the big boys who’s jobs consist on cut costs and increase profits will realize that they can’t remplace us.

Personally, I don’t think AI will replace us soon, but It’ll change our career / rol required soft and hard skill. I think now it’s more importan than ever to have knowledge about stuff related to other roles like product, business, devops, security. I think is call “be T Shape”.

I hope you guys understand me, because I feel I explained this really badly 🤣

↳ **u/popje** (1 pts)

AI won't replace us, but you'll be replaced nonetheless if you either don't use AI, aren't as fast as one or don't have other useful skills. Adapt or be left behind, web dev always been like that.

I don't see this happening any time soon. Yes, I have checked out the Opus 4.5. Sure, it can generate nice fullstack boilerplate. But software is more than that. Once you gain more industry experience and dive into complex systems, you might realise, it consists of messy processes/environments and vague requirements.

Imagine AI replaced the developers, now stakeholder prompts:

\- make the dashboard faster!

Sure! AI can optimize the code till infinity but at that point maybe app needs a new instance, or maybe a new cache/db service, maybe problem in server OS...?? Most importantly stakeholder has no idea about this underlying problems.

AI still needs someone to operate it.

    Ai can only write code, and other than the amount of code it can generate in a short span it's not particularly exceptional at that.  Learn to solve problems.  Learn the soft skills needed to architect solutions across teams.

    Most of all, learn what all high income devs already have learned:  how to make your performance review look good even though everything is BS.

    ↳ **u/EveYogaTech** (1 pts)

    I'd say learn to automate.

    Not just the tools, but the actual deeper value and opportunity that it facilitates.

    Before AI we could use our time or delegate.

    With AI, and by extensions, a revolution in automation, we now have some capability to build new things without being limited by time.

    This could also mean a huge private collection of rules and files for generating specific output on demand to make yourself incredibly valuable to those who are looking for that output.

    Before this may have been frameworks or software, and it still can be as well, but the AI makes such a private collection potentially even more powerful.
