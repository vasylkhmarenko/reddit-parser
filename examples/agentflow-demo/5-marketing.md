## 4. Comment Strategy

### Finding Relevant Threads

**Search queries to monitor daily:**

- "AI replacing developers"
- "should I learn AI"
- "junior developer job"
- "career advice frontend"
- "what should I learn 2026"
- "afraid of AI"
- "doom scrolling"

**Subreddits to monitor:**

- r/webdev (primary)
- r/learnprogramming
- r/cscareerquestions
- r/reactjs
- r/ExperiencedDevs

### Response Templates

**For AI anxiety threads:**

```
I went through this exact spiral a few months ago. What helped me
was actually using the AI tools instead of just reading about them.
Once you understand their limitations firsthand, the fear drops
significantly.

The key insight for me: AI is really good at writing boilerplate,
really bad at debugging complex systems and understanding business
context. Focus on the latter.
```

**For "what should I learn" threads:**

```
Unpopular opinion: learning "AI" as a skill isn't the answer.
Learning to orchestrate AI tools effectively is.

Think of it like knowing how to manage a team vs. doing every
task yourself. The valuable skill is knowing what to delegate
and how to verify quality.
```

**For career advice threads:**

```
The junior hiring market is brutal right now, not going to lie.
But here's what I've seen work:

1. Build projects that show you understand AI augmentation
   (not just use it as a crutch)
2. Focus on skills AI still sucks at (debugging, architecture,
   communication)
3. Document your learning journey publicly

The devs getting hired are showing they can work WITH AI,
not compete against it.
```

### When to Mention Product

**DO mention when:**

- Someone directly asks for resources/tools
- Thread is specifically about learning AI skills
- You've already provided substantial value in the thread
- Someone expresses exact pain point product solves

**DON'T mention when:**

- First comment in thread
- Thread is about something adjacent but not directly related
- Comment section is negative/hostile
- You haven't built rapport in that subreddit yet

## 6. Risk Mitigation

### Handling Negative Feedback

**Response framework:**

1. Thank them genuinely (even if harsh)
2. Ask clarifying questions
3. Acknowledge valid points publicly
4. Never get defensive
5. Follow up if you implement their suggestion

**Example response to criticism:**

```
Appreciate the honest feedback. You're right that [acknowledged issue].
I hadn't considered [their point].

Would [proposed solution] address your concern? Genuinely trying
to make this useful, not just another cash grab course.
```

### Avoiding Bans

**DO:**

- Maintain 10:1 ratio of helpful content to any self-promotion
- Always disclose you built it when mentioning product
- Respect each subreddit's specific rules
- Build genuine relationships before promoting

**DON'T:**

- Use multiple accounts to upvote/comment on your posts
- Post same content across subreddits simultaneously
- Argue with moderators
- Delete posts that get negative reception (looks sketchy)

### If Banned

1. Don't create alt accounts immediately
2. Message mods politely asking for clarification
3. Accept the ban gracefully if deserved
4. Wait 30+ days before any appeal
5. Pivot to other subreddits/platforms

### Authenticity Maintenance

**Keep yourself honest:**

- Use real account with post history
- Share genuine failures, not just wins
- Respond to criticism thoughtfully
- Actually implement community feedback
- Thank people who helped publicly
